# drawShapes_Demo

This is a demo video of my drawShapes project. The code can be shared upon request

### App platform
Ali Lakhani 20671281 a25lakha openjdk version "12.0.2" macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra (MacBook Pro 2018) This app was made on Android Studio and works for the Pixcel C on API 29 as required.

### Objective
This application is a custom paint application. Users can draw circles, lines and squares - all of which can be directly manipulated by using the selection tool once an object is drawn. Moreover the color pallet will allow users to change colors of their drawings on a ad hoc basis. The application has been customized to allows users to not only delete selected drawings, but also undo actions with the respective undosquare, undoline and undocircle buttons. When initialy drawing any of the 3 objects the size can be altered by draging your finger or pointer on the screen! Enjoy :)
